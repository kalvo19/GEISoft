a set of monitoring tools that allow you to make sure that the package is running
correctly.

DOCXPRESSO v2.0 Release Notes
============================
DOCXPRESSO v2.0 comes bundle with a great deal of new features that will help you
to generate beautiful business reports and general purpose document even easier
than before.

Besides a bunch of minor improvements and bug fixes in the core functionality of
the library, v2.0 incorporates full support for templates and themes.

Templates
---------

In DOCXPRESSO v2.0 templates are much more than passive receptacles for 
additional custom content, thanks to the new Templates subpackage you may:

    * Clone arbitrary sections of the template: paragraphs, tables, sections, 
      chapters, images, charts and bookmarked text and insert it anywhere else 
      within the template.
    * Replace placeholder variables (or plain text) by plain text, HTML content 
      and/or document fragments.
    * Remove arbitrary template contents so there is no need to use different 
      templates for slightly different final documents.
    * Modify chart data without altering its format and display features.
    * Locate the cursor anywhere within the template so one may insert content 
      at ease wherever required.

Thanks to this new extended API you may generate with a few lines of code, and 
the help of a template, a truly sophisticated data driven document streamlining 
all the required design process.

Themes
------

The main goal of the Themes subpackage is to simplify the creation of richly 
formatted content with the core API of DOCXPRESSO.

You may now use theme stylesheets that allows for the straightforward generation 
of paragraphs, titles and tables that automatically incorporate all their 
predefined formatting.

In particular DOCXPRESSO v2.0 comes already bundled with a "word-blue" theme that
mimics the styling of the latest versions of the Microsoft Office suite. You 
may, of course, build your own themes just by modifying this one or creating 
them directly from scratch.
